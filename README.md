Indie Artists in Los Angeles

Indie Artists in Los Angeles is a powerful Full-Stack Web App with multiple capabilities. It allows users to do a search for upcoming indie music attractions around the greater Los Angeles area. IndieLA utilizes Ticket Master API to display upcoming Concert Dates, Artist Information, and ticket info. A user can login, register to save favorite artists for later viewing. 

The local artists information appears on the bottom half of the screen, with links to purchase tickets, and a modal option to watch their music videos using the YouTube API. 

Future plans include recommendations for similar artists and specific venue targeting.
